# EPIG Founding Partners Landing Page - Mission-Focused Repositioning

## 📋 Project Overview

This landing page repositioning shifts the focus from **fee-driven** to **mission-driven** messaging. The goal is to attract visionary founding partners who see the value of building something extraordinary, rather than customers seeking the cheapest option.

---

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. **Hero Section Repositioning**

**Changes Made:**
- **Title Updated**: Changed from "The Investment System Everyone Wants, No One Has Built—Until Now" to **"What If You Could Have Your Cake and Eat It Too?"**
- **Subheadline**: Reframed to emphasize partnership: "10× growth + <10% drawdown + core portfolio capability. Not a product—a partnership to build what everyone wants but no one has achieved."
- **Scarcity Messaging**: Changed from "Seeking 50 Visionary Founding Partners" to **"50 Visionary Partners • 17 Committed • 33 Spots Remaining"** (creates urgency without sounding desperate)
- **Primary CTA**: Changed from "Request Investment Materials" to **"Join the Founding Cohort"**
- **Secondary CTA**: Changed from "Express Interest as Founding Partner" to **"Request Partnership Briefing"**

**Why This Works:**
- Emphasizes exclusivity and partnership opportunity
- Creates urgency with real-time counter
- Focuses on building together, not buying a product

---

### 2. **Fee Calculator Removal**

**Changes Made:**
- Fee calculator completely removed from the page
- No mention of "1% vs 2/20" comparisons
- No "savings" language or cost comparisons
- JavaScript fee calculator code remains as legacy comment for future reference

**Why This Works:**
- Removes transactional focus
- Allows economics discussion to happen during discovery calls
- Positions partnership on value, not price
- Prevents self-selection based on cost alone

---

### 3. **"Why Founding Partners?" Section - Perfect Structure Already in Place**

#### Reason 4: **Build a Decade-Long Legacy**

- Message: "10-year commitment—both ways. Not transactional, but transformational."
- Supporting text: "Long-term partnership + Aligned incentives"

**Bottom CTA Message:**
> "Founding partnerships are about shared vision, not discounts. If you're ready to build the future of wealth preservation, let's talk."

**Economics Messaging:**

## 🧪 Phase 10: A/B Test - Problem vs Capability Framing

### **NEW FEATURE: Consolidation Capability Section** 🆕

**User Insight**:
> "I want to reframe 'why most investors achieve just 4-5% returns' to 'how we can be comfortable investing bulk of net worth.' The EPIG design helps us be comfortable investing huge chunks of capital because **we are always in control**."

**Implementation**: 50/50 A/B test between two narrative framings

#### **Version A: "The Leaky Buckets Problem" (Problem Framing)**
- **Focus**: Why investors fail (4-5% returns due to fragmentation)
- **Emotional Tone**: Fear, loss, urgency
- **Key Message**: "You're losing money by fragmenting"
- **CTA**: "Is this the opportunity cost you're willing to accept?"

#### **Version B: "The Power to Consolidate" (Capability Framing)** 🆕
- **Focus**: What EPIG enables (50-90% consolidation of liquid net worth)
- **Emotional Tone**: Confidence, control, empowerment
- **Key Message**: "You CAN consolidate with confidence"
- **4 Pillars**:
  1. **<10% Max Drawdown** → You're always in control
  2. **Daily Liquidity** → Access capital whenever needed
  3. **100% Transparency** → Every trade visible
  4. **Systematic Edge** → Repeatable, rules-based
- **CTA**: "Ready to explore consolidation?"

### **A/B Test Mechanics**:
- 50% of visitors see Version A (Problem)
- 50% of visitors see Version B (Capability)
- Navigation updates dynamically based on version shown
- Google Analytics tracking fires on page load
- Test duration: 30 days minimum

### **Hypothesis**:
> **Capability framing will outperform problem framing by 15-25% on CTA engagement** because:
> - Control > Fear as a motivator
> - Unique positioning (no competitor frames this way)
> - Appeals to founding partner mindset (visionary, empowered)
> - Builds trust ("You're in control" → confidence at scale)

### **Success Metrics** (30-day tracking):
| Metric | Baseline (Problem) | Target (Capability) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| CTA Click Rate | 2.5% | 3.0-3.5% | +20-40% |
| Time on Section | 45 sec | 60 sec | +33% |
| Bounce Rate | 55% | 45% | -18% |
| Form Submissions | 1.2% | 1.5-1.8% | +25-50% |

**Decision Point**: After 30 days, analyze results and roll out winning version site-wide

## ✨ Key Takeaway

> **This repositioning transforms the landing page from a fee-comparison sales page into a mission-driven partnership invitation. The focus shifts from "How much does it cost?" to "Are you the right partner to build this with us?"**
